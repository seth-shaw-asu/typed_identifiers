Notes to Guide Development
==========================

I'm cribbing bits from the core's `agent_identifier` while also using the two plugins listed below as a bit of a map (since finding all the `agent_identifier` bits among all the other pieces is a bit of a pain.

## Plugin References

Not sure if either of these work with the current version of ArchivesSpace, but they are at least a starting point.

- [hudmol/payments_module](https://github.com/hudmol/payments_module): adds some new schema and enumerations. Includes a method of doing an initial enumeration load from a provided key-value TSV. (Latest release: Oct 2020.)
- [WGBH-MLA/pbspace](https://github.com/WGBH-MLA/pbspace): Adds both an "additional identifier" as well as an "additional title" to assist with PBCore metadata. (Last update: Aug 2019.)
